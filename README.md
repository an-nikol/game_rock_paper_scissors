`The Rock, Paper and Scissors Game is a two-player game in which you and the opponent(the computer) choose at the same time one of the following options: **rock, paper or scissors.** The rules of the game are:

 * Rock beats Scissors
 * Scissors beat Rock
 * Paper beats Rock
The player picks one of the presented options and the computer **randomly** makes a choice as well. Then, the program **keeps track of the current score.** When the **neccessary number of wins** are made by one of the parties, the program **prints the finals result and reveals the winner**.

## Input 
First, the player is prompted to enter one of two options:
**3** to play in a mode Best out of 3 or
**5** to play in a mode Best out of 5.

Then, the player chooses between:
**r** which stands for "Rock"
**p** for "PaperP
**s** for "Scissors".

Finally, if the player wants to quit the game prematurely, he or she may type **Q** at any stage of the game.

## Output

If the user has chosen:
* *3* to play the game in a mode of Best out of 3, the result of the game is printed when one party has scored 2 consecutive wins.
* *5* to play Best out of 5, the final result is printed when one party has scored 3 consecutive wins.
If the player has typed a different number (other than 3 or 5), the program informs the user of the invalid input and prompts the player to type again.
